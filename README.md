To install dependencies, run the following command in the command line:
```
sudo apt install build-essential cmake libglew-dev libglfw3-dev libsdl2-dev libogg-dev libtheora-dev libvorbis-dev git libgbm-dev libdrm-dev
```
To clone the source code, open a terminal in your desired folder and run one of the following commands:
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/RSDKModding/RSDKv3-Decompilation
git clone --recursive https://github.com/RSDKModding/RSDKv4-Decompilation
git clone --recursive https://github.com/RSDKModding/RSDKv5-Decompilation
git clone --recursive https://github.com/RSDKModding/Sonic-Mania-Decompilation
```
For Sonic Forever and Sonic 2 Absolute use this command:
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/ElspethThePict/TeamForever-v4-1.3.git
```
The Linux version is not officially supported, so please donâ€™t ask the original developers for support.


After cloning the source code, build it into binaries by running the following commands in the terminal. (Note: This will not work for Sonic Forever or 2 Absolute; use the command below instead.)
```
cmake -B build
cmake --build build --config release
```
For Sonic Forever and Sonic 2 Absolute
```
make -j5
```
If your distro is using gcc 8.x.x then run the command below insted:
```
make -j5 LIBS=-lstdc++fs
```
You can check the gcc version your distro is using by typing this command in the terminal:
```
gcc -v
```
